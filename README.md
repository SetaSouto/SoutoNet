# Torchsight

**WARNING**: This package is currently under development.

Torchsight is a package that contains novel models for the *few-shot* object detection task.

This package was created to not only provide some novel models for object detection, it's also
a framework to avoid boilerplate code that we usually see during the development of
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) experiments.

In this package you will find ready to use some `Datasets`, `Loggers`, `Losses`, `Metrics`,
`Optimizers`, `Trainers` and `Transforms`.

If you are a pytorch user probably you already know what is a `Dataset` or an `Optimizer`, but
the `Logger` and `Trainer` classes are new. This classes will help us to abstract the some tasks
allowing us to reuse code in a beautiful way.

## Quick start

TODO

## Installation

The package is not ready yet, but if you want, you can clone the repo, create a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
environment with the dependencies and start using the models.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SetaSouto/torchsight.git
cd torchsight
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then install the `torchsight` package in development mode:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```
