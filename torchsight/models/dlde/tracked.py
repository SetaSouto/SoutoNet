    """Directional classification module.

    This module takes the features generated by the Feature Pyramid Network and generates
    "embeddings" (normalized vectors for each base anchor) that must point in the same direction
    that its correct label and so it can calculate the probability of being for a given class.

    So, in simple words, we take a picture and project each section of the image to a sphere with
    unit radius. Each section has an embedding, a vector that points in some direction that it is
    in this sphere.

    What we are going to do? We are going to try that embeddings of similar objects (i.e. same class)
    point to the same direction. It would be an error that the embeddings point to the exact same
    direction, we must have a threshold, so we can model this with a Von Mises-Fisher distribution.

    At this point we need a picture, check this and create your mental image:
    ![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTDBP4M7VABT1wGuXccdg707MzyQPTpb5O6D3TUCZFapDBG_jiX)

    So, we want that semantically similar objects points to similar directions, so the direction of the
    embedding contains the semantic of the object without losing much visual detail.

    I was inspired by the following paper:

    _Directional Statistics-based Deep Metric Learning for Image Classification and Retrieval._
    [Paper in Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09662)

    But there is a problem: If we use only this approach we use a thing similar to a softmax but over the
    cosine similarity of the embedding with each class' mean, as the softmax always gives a winner
    this won't allow us to identify correctly a background embedding, i.e., a non interesting object
    for the model.

    To avoid this, we can use the sigmoid function instead of the softmax. But if we only use
    the cosine similarity and the sigmoid function it could be impossible to have a precision of 1
    (because sigmoid(maximum cosine similarity = 1) = 0.7311).
    So we must add a weight and a bias to modify the sigmoid and get coherent values.

    How can it update the means?
    Because every time that the embeddings pass through the network we must provide the real annotations
    to update the classes' means with those embeddings. Not a fully update of course, we sum this embeddings
    to the previously seen embeddings and then you can call model.update_means() to normalize those sums
    and set them as the new means for each class.

    Obviously, a correct way to set a more precise mean is to call update_means() after each epoch,
    because it will compute the mean with the average of the class' embeddings.

        How could you fit them in only one tensor for the batch? You know that the maximum amount
        of annotations is 3 so you could generate a tensor with shape (2, 3, 5): 2 images, 3 'maximum
        amount of annotations' and 5 values for each annotation. But what are the values for the
